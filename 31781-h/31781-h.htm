<p class="poem">
"Camerado, this is no book;<br />
Who touches this touches a man."</p>

<p>Walt Whitman's relation to his work was more personal than that of most
poets. He was, in a larger sense, a man of one book, and this book,
issued and reissued at various periods of the poet's life, was, at each
issuance, the latest expression of his development. The infinite care he
gave to his work; the continual study of each poem resulted in changes
in each edition. The book literally grew with the man and in the present
authorized edition of today we have his final and complete utterance.</p>

<p>Whitman's early fugitive work presents to the student a curious anomaly.
It gives no intimation of the great nature that later produced Leaves of
Grass and Democratic Vistas. In quality it was beneath the standards of
the nickle-dreadfuls of yesterday. Bearing such titles as "One Wicked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>Impulse"; "Revenge and Requital, Tale of a Murderer Escaped"; "The
Angel of Tears"; (many of them are in the Prose Works) they appealed to
a class to whom thought was anathema and reading solely a pastime. They
are didactic to the extreme, presenting the horrible results of sin and
the corresponding rewards of virtue. Their value as literature, however,
does not come within the province of the bibliographer.</p>

<p>The care Whitman bestowed upon his writings was carried to the
mechanical production of his books. Each edition was manufactured under
his supervision and when completed represented the latest and highest
achievements in commercial bookmaking. Further, he took such an intense
personal interest in the sale of his books that he invariably knew at
all times the number of copies sold and the number on hand.</p>

<p>The first edition comprised three distinct variations. The first of
these, in paper wrappers, are undoubtedly the result of Whitman's
impatience at the delays of the binder. Considering that he had a press
at his disposal, it is not assuming too much to suggest that while
awaiting deliveries from the binder he printed the jackets himself for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>immediate use. This is the only way to account for the existence of the
paper copies. Further proof that this contention is correct is that each
copy bears an inscription in Whitman's holograph.</p>

<p>Though Whitman insisted that "the entire edition sold readily" there is
little doubt he meant circulated. In fact, they were circulated so
rapidly a new edition was required within ten months. This second
edition was a dumpy sexto-decimo of nearly four hundred pages. Twenty
new poems were added, one of the earlier poems was dropped and all were
retouched. This edition did sell rapidly and only fear of public
criticism prevented the publishers from reissuing the book. The failure
to find a firm to stand sponsor for his book discouraged Whitman to the
extent of planning to go West and pioneer. His plans for this venture
were completed when Thayer and Eldridge opened negotiations for the
book's republication with any new material available. This offer took
the poet to Boston to oversee the work and in May, 1860, a substantial
volume, with many new poems came from the press. The book went through
two editions, a total of between thirty-five hundred and four thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
copies when the publishers failed. The plates were sold at auction and
went to a notorious pirate, who, within the next ten years, published
and sold over ten thousand copies. Whitman had no control over these
crimped editions and forever after they were a torment to him.</p>

<p>It was not until after the Civil War that a new authentic edition was
published&mdash;again without a publisher. In later issues of this edition
Whitman bound in the sheets of "Drum-Taps" and "When Lilacs Last in the
Dooryard Bloom'd," and in still later issues, "Songs Before Parting."
The total number of copies issued is not known but must have been quite
small owing to the effect of the lower priced pirated edition.</p>

<p>The fifth edition was published in Washington and attracted little or no
attention save in England where the demand for complete and unabridged
copies was fostered by Rossetti's emasculated edition. The English
demand was so great that Whitman was compelled to reprint one or two new
editions. He got around the expense of new plates by inserting
"intercallations"&mdash;poems printed on separate slips of paper and tipped
in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1881, the next Boston edition was issued. With a recognized publisher
of Osgood's standing there should have been no question of the final
success of "Leaves of Grass." Osgood published all the work of the New
Englanders; Longfellow, Lowell, Emerson and Whittier. Whitman was in
good company save that the Society for the Suppression of Vice
considered "Leaves of Grass" to be bad company and through District
Attorney Stevens secured its suppression. Osgood promptly withdrew the
book and gladly turned over to the author all unsold and unbound copies
and the plates. The plates went to Rees, Welsh and Company, of
Philadelphia, who brought out an edition and then dropped from sight.
David McKay published an edition from the same plates. During this time
certain "special" and "author's" editions were published by Whitman as
his own publisher.</p>

<p>After Whitman's death Small, Maynard &amp; Company, of Boston, became the
authorized publishers. They were followed in turn by D. Appleton and
Company, and Mitchell Kennerley. At this writing Messrs. Doubleday, Page
&amp; Co. are the authorized publishers of "Leaves of Grass," and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
"Prose Works."</p>

<p>Any bibliography of Whitman's Works can be called but an attempt. His
temperamental handling of the plates of the various editions of "Leaves
of Grass" resulted in many curious imprints. There may be omissions, I
grant, but not serious ones. The work I undertook was a clearing up of
the fog which hung about the various Boston editions and setting
cataloguers right on the first edition.</p>

<p>I must, at this point, thank Anne Montgomerie Traubel, of Camden, Mr.
Walter Bartley Quinlan and Mr. Alfred F. Goldsmith, of New York, and Mr.
Henry S. Saunders, of Toronto, Canada, for valuable suggestions and
comparison of notes, and Mr. M. M. Breslow for permission to use his
very excellent collection of Whitmaniana as a basis for this
bibliography.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>The arrangement is chronological, the only practicable method.</p>

<p>In listing titles and imprints I have sought to follow the typography
and punctuation of the originals. Where this was not practicable I have
inserted punctuation marks to give the matter coherence. Where I have
interpolated remarks or descriptions within the titles I have enclosed
them in brackets to distinguish them from Whitman's parenthesis.</p>

<p>The New World. Extra Series. Number 34. New York, November, 1842.
Original Temperance Novel. Franklin Evans; or The Inebriate. A Tale of
the Times. By Walter Whitman.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Royal octavo, pp. 31, uncut.</p>

<p>Published as an extra to "<i>The New World</i>."</p>

<p>The last page (32) contains advertisement: "New Works in Press."</p>

<p>Written during Whitman's Bohemian days it was advertised as a
thrilling romance by one of the best novelists in this country
and had a sale of between 20,000 and 25,000 copies, which netted
the author about $200. References to the work in later years
irritated Whitman and he refused to discuss it. The work is
extremely scarce considering the great number that were
published.</p>

<h2 class="small">1855</h2>

<p>Leaves of Grass. Brooklyn, New York. 1855.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>First edition. Twelve poems.</p>

<p>Imperial octavo, pink paper wrappers.</p>

<p>"Leaves of Grass" printed in block letters across front wrapper,
end wrapper blank. Steel engraved portrait, title, uncaptioned
preface, xii, Leaves of Grass, pp. 95, end blank.</p>

<p>The author's name appears only in the copyright notice, and in
the first poem: "Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a
kosmos."</p>

<p>The poems, twelve in number, are without titles. In the present
authorized edition they appear under the following titles:</p>

<p class="list">
Song of Myself.<br />
A Song for Occupations.<br />
To Think of Time.<br />
The Sleepers.<br />
I Sing the Body Electric.<br />
Faces.<br />
Song of the Answer (part one).<br />
Europe.<br />
A Boston Ballad.<br />
There Was a Child Went Forth.<br />
Who Learns My Lesson Complete.<br />
Great Are the Myths.<br />
</p>

<p>The preface was later worked into three poems:</p>

<p class="list">
By Blue Ontario's Shore.<br />
Song of Prudence.<br />
To a Foil'd European Revolutionaire.<br />
</p>

<p>There are three variations of the first edition. The one noted
above in pink wrappers is unquestionably the first issue. The
second issue is bound in green cloth, gilt edges, and with the
title stamped in rustic letters in gilt on the front cover. The
last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> issue of this edition has all the points of the second
issue with eight pages of press notices bound in at the front.</p>

<p>Less than nine hundred copies were printed in July, 1855, in the
printshop of Andrew H. Rome, 98 Cranberry Street, Brooklyn, the
author assisting in the type composition and presswork. The
volume was placed on sale at Fowler &amp; Wells, Broadway, New York,
and at Swaynes, in Fulton Street, Brooklyn, at two dollars, but
was later reduced to one dollar. Very few copies were sold;
Whitman giving almost the entire edition to critics and friends.</p>

<p>Catalogued from the Maier copy.</p>
</div>

<p class="space">A reprint of this edition was issued in January, 1920, by Mr.
Thomas B. Mosher, Portland, Maine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="small">1856</h2>

<p>Leaves of Grass. Brooklyn, New York. 1856.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Second edition. Thirty-two poems.</p>

<p>Thick 16mo, green drab cloth, sprinkled edges. Title stamped in
gilt on face of binding; on back title and quotation from
Emerson's letter "I Greet You at the Beginning of a Great
Career, R. W. Emerson," portrait, same as in the first edition,
title, contents, iv, Leaves of Grass, pp. (5)-342, Leaves
Droppings (reprint of Emerson's letter; Whitman's letter to
Emerson and press notices), pp. 345-384, advertisement. Owing to
the storm of criticism which arose against the book, Fowler &amp;
Wells, the New York publishers, refused to put their name on the
title page, and though they attended to all the details of
presswork and distribution, the volume was issued from Brooklyn,
without imprint. It is said that there are copies in existence
bearing Fowler &amp; Wells imprint, but this is doubtful as such
copies are unknown to Whitman collectors. In this edition the
prose preface of the first edition is worked into four poems: By
Blue Ontario's Shore; Song of the Answerer, part two; To a
Foil'd European Revolutionaire, and Song of Prudence; the
balance being reprinted in Specimen Days and Collect, 1881.</p>

<p>Owing to the refusal of Fowler &amp; Wells to stand sponsor to the
volume, only 1,000 copies were printed and the book was out of
print 1858-1860.</p>

<p>Third edition. 154 poems.</p>

<p>Duodecimo, brown cloth, heavily blind embossed. Portrait, at the
age of forty, engraved by Schoff, after the painting by Charles
Hine, in 1859, on an irregular tinted background, title,
contents, pp. iv-456.</p>

<p>Issued May, 1860. The author went to Boston to superintend
the printing and binding. The publishers failed during the
period of financial depression at the beginning of the Civil War
and the plates were sold at auction to R. Worthington, who
surreptitiously used them with the original imprint. There are,
for this reason, four or more editions bearing the original
Thayer and Eldridge imprint. The first issue is distinguished by
the engraved portrait which is on an irregular tinted background
and by the gilt embossed butterfly on the backbone of the
binding. On the verso of the title is the inscription
"Electrotyped at the Boston Stereotype Foundry. Printed by
George C. Rand &amp; Avery." The second issue has the portrait on
white paper and lacks the gilt butterfly. The third issue, or
the first pirated issue, lacks the printer's inscription and is
bound in cheap cloth. Early issues, all spurious, contain
catalogues of Worthington's publications bound in at the end.
The plates were purchased by Whitman's literary executors after
his death.</p>

<p>In this edition the author abandons calling the months by their
common names and adopts the Quaker style: that of calling
September the Ninthmonth, etc.</p>

<p>Copies of the first issue with the tinted portrait are extremely
scarce. The various editions have heretofore remained
undistinguished.</p>

on front cover, title, contents, iv, pp. 5-72.</p>

<p>But few copies had been issued when the death of President
Lincoln occurred and the author withheld the balance until a few
weeks later when he added "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard
Bloom'd and other Pieces," with pagination distinct from that of
Drum-Taps, as a sequel. This and the "Sequel" formed the first
and second annexes to the fourth edition, 1867, of Leaves of
Grass, and were later incorporated in the Washington, 1871
edition under the title of Drum-Taps. Copies without the

<p>The volume contains the following by Walt Whitman:</p>

<p class="list">
Walt Whitman and his Poems, pp. 13-21.<br />
Leaves of Grass: a volume of poems just published, pp. 23-26.<br />
An English and an American Poet, pp. 27-32.<br />
Letters in Sickness: Washington, 1873, pp. 73-92.<br />
</p>

<p>The first three articles were written by Whitman during 1855-56
and sent to the newspapers anonymously. He insisted that
considering the misunderstanding and abuse accorded to Leaves of
Grass, he was compelled to resort to these methods to defend his
work in columns that would have been otherwise closed to him.
The latter was a series of letters to his mother.</p>
